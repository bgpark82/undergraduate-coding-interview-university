# Undergraduate Coding Interview University

> I created this to organize the topics for computer science for becoming a software developer. I graduated a university in South Korea studying environment engineering and have no computer science related degree. I decided to change my career to software engineering after finishing an internship in San Francisco as a data analyst in 2016. but it was quite frustrating the fact that I wasn't able to enter the company that I wanted since starting a new career without a related degree and start later than other programmers who have been on their path. Fortunately, I got hired as a web developer for a startup starting from April 29th, 2019.

> I want to prove myself and my family that this is the thing I am passionate about and that I can do better than anything else.
