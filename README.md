# Undergraduate Coding Interview University

> I created this to organize the topics for computer science for becoming software developer. I graduated an university in South Korea studying an environment engineering and have no computer science related degree. I decided to change my career to software engineering after finish internship in San Francisco as a data analyst in 2016. but it was quite frustrating the fact that I wasn't able to enter the company where I wanted since starting new career without related degree and pretty old age compare to other programmers who have been walking on their path. Fortunately, I got hired as a web developer form a startup starting from April 29th, 2019.
> I want to prove myself and my family that this is the thing that I can do better than any other stuffs and I like the most.
